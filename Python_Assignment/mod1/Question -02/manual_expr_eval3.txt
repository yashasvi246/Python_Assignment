Expression-3
a,b,c,y=4.4,0.0,4.2,3.0
ans=c+a*y*y/b
Steps:
1.firstly, lexical Phase will evaluate as 
ans=4.2+4.4*3.0*3.0/0.0
2. Precedence of * is more over +/- , so it will be eveluated as-
ans=4.2+13.2*3.0/0.0
ans=4.2+39.6/0.0
3. Division by Zero not defined so Semantic Phase  will generate an exception.

Answer:
ans=not defined
