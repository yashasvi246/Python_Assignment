Question.01

a = 4*3/4+4/4+8-2+5/8
 
Steps:
1.Precedence of * and  / are the higher than + /- so we evaluate them first. As there are  both * and / both are multiple so we will check for associativity. Associativity of * and / is from Left to Right.
a=12/4+4/4+8-2+5/8
a=3+4/4+8-2+5/8
a=3+1+8-2+5/8
2.Now the precedence of +/- are same and their associativity is left to right so we evaluate it as-
a=3+1+8-2+0.625
a=4+8-2+0.625
a=12-2+0.625
a=10+0.625
a=10.625
